JS Templates
-----------------
## Template literals (Template strings)
  - Template Literals are in backticks ( `` ) and use the dollar sign and curly braces. Ex: `${name}, Thank you for your info!'
  - It default function concatenates the expression into a single string.
  
  - Multi-line strings: 
      - With normal strings you use the \n syntax to get a new line.
      - With template literals you use the backticks to acomplish the same thing.
 
 - Using template literals as 'syntactic sugar' it makes the code more readable.
 - Template strings use placeholders
 - Can also use expressions inside the template literals ex: let total = `The total price is ${price * tax`};
 
 ## Array Methods
  - forEach() array method executes a fuction one time for each array element. This function calls a callback fucntion once for 
  each element in the array, in ascending order.
  - forEach() only works on arrays.
  - They read better that regular for loops
    -- callback: It acceptes between 1 and 3 argumerns, and is a function to execute on each element.
        #1. The value of the element
        #2. The index
        #3. The array object 
        
   -- currentValue: the current element in the array.

##Applying Atomic Design

DESIGN PART
--Start big and work down
  --Page: Full Page
  --Organisms: Large Sections from the page
  --Molecules: Smaller Sections from the Organisms
  --Atoms: Basic HTML and the smallest part broken down
  
CODE PART
--Start small and work up
--Make your components as small and independent as you can

--Use Components when designing pages

##Thinking in React
--Start with a Mock
  -- Step 1: Break The UI into components
      --Make your component hierarchy
  -- Step 2: Build a static version first
      --pass data using props
      --Build top-down or bottom-up
  -- Step 3: Identify the minimal representation of UI State
     --Think DRY code
  -- Step 4: Identify where state should live
    --Find out which component owns the state
  -- Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow
 
 ##CallBacks
 --It is a function psses into another function as an argument
 --A callback is a functiom that runs after another function is finished
 --JS is an event driven language, it keeps working while listening for other events
 --First Class Functions: assing a function to a variable, pass a function as an Argument, or
 retuen a function.
 -- ()() will invoke a returned function as well
 --one callback function is .then()
 
 ##JS Classes
 --In JS a class is a kind of function
 --They can be defined inside anther expression, passed, returned, assigned and more
 --We need to provide a constructor
 --It is an object
 --To extend another class we can use keyword extends
 
 ##This
 --It is an object method
